## Summary

Several Years ago, I have been to Nepal to serve as a volunteer, which is one of the best parts of my life. Some places that I have been to are shown below.

```{r leaflet}
library(leaflet)
latLong  <- data.frame(latitude = c(27.7033170000, 27.7014620000, 27.7138710000), longitude = c(85.3169620000, 85.3120760000, 85.3217770000), popup = c("Tundikhel", "Dharahara", "Narayanhiti"))
my.nvc <- latLong %>% leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% addMarkers(popup = latLong$popup)
my.nvc
```
